<h2>Senses</h2>
<p>The cat's senses are tailored to hunting. Cats are more sensitive than other mammals because of their highly developed hearing, sight, taste, and touch.</p>

<p>Cats have better night vision than humans, but their daytime vision is worse than humans. Cats can hear a hearing section similar to humans in the low-pitched range, but 64 kHz sounds in the high-pitched range, and their sense of smell is about 14 times stronger than humans.
  Due to mutations in early cat ancestors, cats lost one of the two genes needed to taste sweet.
To help with movement and perception, cats have dozens of movable beards on their faces.</p>
