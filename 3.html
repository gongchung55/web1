<h2>Behavior</h2>

<h4>Sociability</h4>
<p>Although they do not live in groups, they have a sense of sequence, such as keeping the order of meals of cats in a higher order than themselves.
 The social role of cat crying depends on the intruder and the other three types of sounds. Purring is a greeting between cats or an expression of social interest in injured or sick cats. Chatting means that there is a hidden prey that you want to catch nearby. Trilling is often paid by mother cats when they communicate with their children. In animal behavior, it is said that a person raising a cat plays the role of a mother to a cat.</p>
<h4>Hunting and feeding</h4>
<p>Cats mainly attack rodents such as mice, rabbits, squirrels, and red squirrels, herbivores, and sometimes poultry.</p>
<h4>Grooming</h4>
<p>A cat's tongue has a protrusion containing keratin that extends like a ring toward its throat. Cats decorate themselves by licking their fur with these keratin bumps and saliva. Many cats dress up other cats or people, and cats often lick other cats to show that they have an upper hand in group rankings.</p>
<h4>habit</h4>
<p>Cats are said to have a habit of liking high places like other cats. Because of this habit, cats sometimes jump out of the window, which is called a high-rise syndrome. To prevent this situation, you can install a cat screen on the window.
 The habit of drinking less water does not require much water intake because cats, unlike humans, do not manage heat through sweat.</p>
